# About Myself:

i`m working in small company 
I'm currently working several small web projects (example: [speakers.az](http://speakers.az/)).My goal is to learn everything new and exciting. I love to code and coffee. I can(love) spend a lot of time doing what interests me. My core strengths are in problem solving and fast learning.I want to get knowledge and skills that will be enough for employment in a company.


I work in company in the position of junior front end. I want to become a professional in my field.
i think  i am a good worker and very willing to learn and develop new skills.
I hope that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me go this way and become an experienced Front end developer.
